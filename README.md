# Dera: App

The frontend application (web, Android, iOS, etc) for the Dera project.

This is to be used by visitors, volunteers, and admin staff of Repair Cafes.

By default, connects to the hosted platform. You will need a paid plan for that platform, or you can set the endpoint URL in the app settings.

WIP.
